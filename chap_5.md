Marking Up Text
===============
- Choosing the best element for your content
- Paragraphs and Headings
  - p and h1-h6 (These are all block elements)
  - h1-h6 default render bold and large; don't use these when you just want bold type. instead, style the type to be bold. remember, we want our HTML to be semantic and have meaning
  - INCLUDE Sample text that would have multiple levels of headings 
  - hr = shift in topic or thought
- Three types of lists
  - Ordered Lists (ol, li) - can specify start="#" attribute
  - Unordered Lists (ul, li) - can also be styled for navigation links
  - Definition Lists (dl, dt, dd) - consist of name-value pairs
- More Content Elements
  - Long quotations - blockquote
  - Preformatted text - pre - default, uses monospace type and is good for demonstrating code
  - Figures - figure and figcaption - related content that illustrates or supports point in the text, and caption for the figure

- PRACTICE TIME - marking up a recipe (I have a thousand of these...)


- Organizing content into sections
  Sections and Articles - long articles are easier to use when divided into smaller parts
    Section - thematic group of content
    Article - self-contained, reusable composition (can be used in a different context)
    Can contain each within each other
  
  Aside - tangentially related material (think about it as a sidebar in print)
    Pullquotes, background info, lists of links, callouts, or anything associated with (not critical to)

  Navigation - primary navigation links
    Typically have a list of links in it

  Header and Footer
    Header - introductory material, can include logo, title, and nav, can be used within an article
    Footer - information that typically come at the end of a section; can be used for a whole footer or another sectioning element
      At end of blog post, copyright info, related links to go back and forth

  Addresses - Self Explanatory

- Text-level (inline) elements
  Here are the important ones
  - Emphasized text
  - Important text (strong)

  Old Presentational Elements that now have semantic meaning
  - b - bold
  - i - italic, alternate voice
  - s - strike-through
  - u - annotated text, underline
  - small - legal text, small print

  - Abbreviations or acronyms - titles
  - Citations - cite
  - Defining terms - dfn
  - Program code elements
    - code, var, samp, kbd
  - Subscript and superscript - sub, sup
  - Highlighted text - mark
  - Time and machine-readable info - time[datetime=""], data[value=""]
  - Inserted and deleted text - del[title=""], ins

  Adding Breaks
  - Link breaks - br
  - Word break - wbr - something breaks line, it will break at this point


- As will all elements, don't use them just because of the default ways they are styled


- General elements, div and span
  div - block, span - inline - logical groupin of elements
  product listings, recipes, content
  gives meaning to telephone numbers

  id and class attributes

- Special Characters

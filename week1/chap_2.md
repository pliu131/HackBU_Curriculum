How the Web Works

(old so it uses DSL)

The Internet - Network of connected computers. No one owns the internet, governed by system of standards and rules. Connect computers = passing information in between. Methods of sending data/document are called protocols (email, file transfer)

The Web (WWW) - One of the ways info can be shared over the internet. Documents are linked to each other using hypertext links. Web used protocol called HTTP. (Beginning of every web site)

Servers - "serve up" documents, server is the software on the computer that allows it to communicate with other computers. Basically, wait for a request, that retrieve and send it back as quickly as possible.

IP Address - anything and everything connected to the computer has one, just like everyone with a phone has a phone number. We use the domain name system which allows us to type in google.com instead of its ip address. And for those scams that say everyone can see you IP address, they're right. but you're supposed to. 

Browsers - Software that requests the data is called a client. Desktop and mobile browsers and assistive technologies (screen readers) for people to access the web. Requests and responses handled with the HTTP protocol (images, movies, audio files, data scripts, and other resources). Most popular are IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. 

Alternate web experiences
  - Sight disabilities - listening to web page read by a screen reader or make text very large
  - Limited mobility - Use assistive devices to type and access links
  - Must be usable for all userss

Web Page Address (URL - Uniform Resource Locator)
http[s]://www.example.com/2012/samples/first.html
http[s]://www.example.com/2012/samples/[index.html]
http[s]://www.example.com/2012/samples

http:// - lets the server know to use the HTTP
www.example.com - domain name, www = hostname. Some pages have subdomains (blog.example.com, mobile.example.com)
/2012/samples/first.html - absolute path
  - just like when you go through folders on a computer (users/peter/documents/paper.doc)

Default files - called index.html, you probably noticed this when you go to a website and it goes to index.html
  - When you go to example.com/projects/, you're going to example.com/projects/index.html



Anatomy of a Web Page
- Adding tags to a web page is called "marking up the document"
- Web pages use a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Dozens of elements that describe headers, paragraphs, emphasized text, links, images, videos, inputs, buttons

What do you notice?
- Text within brackets does not display on the page, only the content within the brackets. 
- Most tags surround its content (with the exception of the image, which we'll get to later)

Where are the pictures? 
- Through the img tag, which tells the webpage where the image is located and then renders the image

Stylesheets
- Link element - points to a stylesheet
- CSS - allows designers to add visual style instructions (presentation) to the marked-up text (HTML provides structure)
- Show what the page looks like with and without style

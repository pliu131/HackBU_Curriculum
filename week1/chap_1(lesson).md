Where do I start?
- Don't worry if you're not a computer science major; many web developers and even programmers are self taught and learn by doing it and reading books on their own.
- The first question is "where do I start?"
- The first step is to understand what the web is and how the Web works. You don't want to start building a house without understand its foundation.
- What these workshops will do is teach you the fundamentals. After you understand them, you can advance your education through books and articles on the Internet.
- Everyone here is here for a different reason, from doing this as a hobby and being able to create a website for yourself to wanting to pursue this as a career or find out if this is a viable option for you as a career.
- If you are looking to create a website for yourself, there are a lot of ways to do that very simply through templates on content management systems and blogs.
- If you want to be a professional, you need to work on a lot of projects that look professional so that you can show a potential employer or a potential client if you looking to freelance.


What does a web designer do?
- Web design encompasses many disciplines.
  - Visual (graphic) design
  - UI and UX design
  - Web document and style sheet production
  - Scripting and programming
  - Content strategy
  - Multimedia

- If you work on a website on your own, you'll find yourself wearing multiple hats. Essentially, you'll be maintaining your own website.

- The Four Disciplines we'll discuss

Design
====
- User Experience Design (UX)
  - Making sure that the user's experience on a website is good; it's based on a clear understand of a user's needs and creating an experience that suffices those needs
  - Everything that has to do with the product in terms of a user and a business's needs
  - Think about a website that you find incredibly frustrating to use (Binghamton's new mybinghamton as an example)
  - Think about a website that is very pleasureable to use (Twitter)

- UX Design in itself encompasses many other disciplines, but the big two are
  - Information Architecture
    - Deals with the structure of information on a website to make sure that it's easy to understand where to find the information you need (think navigation on a website in terms of knowing how to get from point A to point B)

  - Interaction and Interface Design
    - Interaction - Make the site easy, efficient, and delightful to use as possible
    - Interface - designing things like menus, buttons, links, inputs

- Recommend Reads
  - A Project Guide to UX Design
  - The Elements of User Experience
  - The UX Book

- While we don't need to do this in class, it's important to always keep user experience in mind when creating a website.
- Will have extra workshops on some techniques used by UX practitioners.
  - User research and testing - interviewing and observing users to understand them; you don't want to create anything users don't need or want and wouldn't know how to use
  - Wireframing - where info is laid out on an individual page (these do not to be hi-fi by any means)
  - Site Diagram/Map - structure of the entire site (show example)
  - Storyboards and User Flow charts - the steps a user will take when using your website

- Visual (Graphic) Design
  - Typically what people think about when they think about design
  - Establishes the look and feel of website (CSS Zen Garden)
  - Makes sure it is consistent with the brand or message of the entity it is designed for
    - This is why some visual designs wouldn't make sense for other companies
  - You also wouldn't necessarily be required to do any HTML/CSS authoring but designing images and assets for a website to use
  - Learn how to use Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe products (Illustrator, InDesign)


Development
======
- Unless you are doing back end work for a website, you don't need any programming experience. Programming will be very minimal (we will be learning a little bit of JavaScript to make websites interactive)

- Authoring/markup
  - Marking up content so that a web browser can understand it
  - Marking up content uses HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
  - It uses this to describe a page's content and its content's function on the page (is this a link/paragraph/header/quote)
  - Key point: HTML describes (to a web browser) the structure of a web page

- Styling
  - The way that a website is presented is determined through a set of style rules written in a language called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets; we'll talk more about the name later)
  - You can change the color and size of a text and or the size of an image or the background color of a section
  - Key point: CSS is the presentational layer of the web page and its logic is kept separately from the HTML (two different files)

- Scripting/Programming 
  - This is what makes web pages interactive and dynamic (using programming languages)
  - JavaScript is used in the web browser to add behavior to websites. Show examples (autocomplete in Google search; think of something funny)
  - It is what makes web pages interactive and adds behavior and functionality to a web page.

  - The other programming languages, like php, Ruby, Python, Java, ASP.net, and now, JavaScript, that are run on the server and process the data to and from the user and the web page (not in the scope of this course) - This allows you to post on social media, purchase items online, and upload documents.

  - This is more directly computer science related, but you can learn on your own as well!

  - Front-end VS Back-End
    - Front-end - Deals with everything in the browser and what a user sees.
      - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, graphic design, interface design
    - Back-end - Deals with everything behind the scenes that makes a web application work and makes them dynamic.
      - Processing forms, content management systems like blogs, dealing with databases

Content Strategy
===
- 90% of the web consists of words.
- Someone has to come up with the content - think about how authors have their own voices; they make sure that websites have the right content

Multimedia
===
- Also not in the scope of this course; videos, photography, sound, animation, interactive games


What languages do I need to learn?
- HTML (structure layer)
- CSS (presentation layer)
- JavaScript and DOM scripting (behavior layer)
  - checking form for valid entries
  - swapping out styles for an element
  - making browser remember info (what are these called? cookies!)
  - interface elements like expanding menus
- Server Side Programming and database management


What Do I Need?
- Hardware - good computer, large monitor*, mobile devices
- Software - text editor, web page authoring (WYSIWYG), image-editing, internet tools (browsers), FTP program, terminal/command line app

Questions
====
- Match professions with deliverable they are responsible for
- Graphic designer - Photoshop page mockup
- User Experience Designer - Storyboards
- [Web] Programmer (Back-end developer) - PHP scripts
- Web Designer (Front-End developer) - HTML and CSS

Match the technology with its task
- HTML - identifies text as a heading
- CSS - makes all headings blue
- JavaScript - Checks form for valid entry
- PHP - creates a server side web application (and Facebook)

What are some differences between a front-end developer and a back-end developer?
